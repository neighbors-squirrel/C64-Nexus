# C64 Nexus  
  
C64 Nexus is an open-source proof-of-concept project that brings the  
Commodore 64 experience into a modern lightweight OS distribution  
for Raspberry Pi.  

It combines:  
- A minimal JeOS-based Raspberry Pi image  
- The VICE emulator as the C64 core  
- A curated repository of recent homebrew C64 titles  
- (Optional) Kodi for media center integration  
- An experimental **AI Companion** mode (retro chatbot / quest generator)  
  
---  
  
## Project Status  
🚧 Proof of Concept (PoC)  
The repo is open for **ideas, experiments, and contributions**.  
This is not a final product, but a starting point for community-driven collaboration.

- [ ] Minimal Debian Lite + VICE build
- [ ] EmulationStation frontend
- [ ] Curated repo of homebrew games
