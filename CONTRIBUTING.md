# Contributing to C64-Nexus

First of all — thanks for checking out this project! 🙌
C64-Nexus is an experiment in bringing the **Commodore 64 community, modern UX, and retro spirit** together.
We welcome contributions of all kinds — code, ideas, documentation, music, testing, feedback.

## How to contribute

1. **Fork this repo** and create a new branch for your feature/bugfix.
2. **Keep commits focused**: one idea per commit.
3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** — describe what you did and why. Screenshots/GIFs are very welcome!
4. **Issues**: If you see a bug or have an idea, open an Issue first. This helps us track and discuss before coding.

## Code style

* Keep it simple. Readability > cleverness.
* Comment tricky parts — remember, future you (and others) will thank you.
* If adding UI/UX, stick to the "Netflix-like" clean aesthetic.

## Community guidelines

* Be kind. Assume good intent.
* Respect the retro community — C64 scene has decades of history, we honor that.
* No gatekeeping — whether you're a coder, musician, or idea person, all contributions matter.

## Music / Extras

If you want to contribute **SID tunes, chiptune tracks, or sound effects**, we’d love that!
Please document which tool you used (GoatTracker, SIDWizard, etc.) so others can learn.
